# ðŸ“Š R-Week2-Sales-Analytics
Week 2 R programming assignment, analyzing a messy sales dataset using data cleaning, date handling, conditional logic, aggregation, and visualization. This repository contains my Week 2 assignment for the **Data Science Internship** at **Neozeno Talent**, under the mentorship of Aishwarya.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Title
**Sales Analytics Using R**

## ðŸ“– Description
In this project, I worked on a real-world retail sales dataset to generate useful insights for business decision-making. This assignment helped me apply key R programming concepts including:

- Handling missing values with `is.na()` and `mean()`.
- Converting and extracting features from dates using `lubridate`.
- Writing loops and `ifelse()` logic.
- Using `aggregate()` for group-wise analysis.
- Creating custom functions like `region_report()`.
- Generating bar, line, and stacked bar plots using `ggplot2`.

## ðŸ§ª Tools Used
- R
- RStudio
- R Markdown (`.Rmd`)
- ggplot2, dplyr, lubridate packages

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `Week2_Sales_Analytics.Rmd`  
- Main R Markdown file containing all code, analysis, and comments.
